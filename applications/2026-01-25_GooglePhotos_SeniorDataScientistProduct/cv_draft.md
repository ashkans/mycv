### Professional Experience

**CSIRO**, Melbourne, Research Scientist | Applied ML	01/2023 – Present
*   Led the design and development of a **production ready data quality control product** that monitored national water data real-time streams, ensuring **data reliability** for downstream users and stakeholders.
*   Built and deployed a **PyTorch-based LSTM model** for streamflow forecasting. This improved forecast accuracy by 20% over baseline models.
*   Engineered a **scalable data processing pipeline** on **Azure** that automated over 2 million simulations, reducing a multi-month workflow to hours. This enabled the use of stochastic ensemble methods to provide deeper insights into climate change impacts, showcasing an ability to identify and leverage growth opportunities in data analysis.
*   Utilized a **LangChain-based LLM workflow** to distill insights from 85+ expert questionnaires, directly influencing research priorities and demonstrating the ability to translate qualitative data into strategic business direction.
*   Architected and built the **Hydrological Reservoir Model (HRM) Python package** for CSIRO's SWIFT forecasting system, featuring a **plugin-ready design**, typed APIs, schema validation, **CI/CD**, and 90%+ test coverage.

**Bureau of Meteorology**, Melbourne, Senior Data Scientist (Hydrologist)	09/2018 – 01/2023
*   Led the **scientific development and extension** of the **AWRA-L hydrological model**, a **national water balance tool** now serving thousands of users via awo.bom.gov.au. This involved integrating large-scale geospatial datasets and developing new stream routing components, significantly improving prediction accuracy.
*   Developed a **random forest anomaly detection system** that processed over 1 million data points with 70% accuracy, specifically identifying early pipe blockage for proactive infrastructure maintenance. This system provided actionable insights and demonstrated an ability to build solutions that address critical user needs.
*   Created an **ML forecasting model** for the Australian Fire Danger Rating System, a critical national product. The model boosted forecast accuracy by 30% up to 3 months in advance, significantly improving the product's value and utility for public safety.
*   Implemented the **Ensemble Kalman Filter** to assimilate satellite data into the **AWRA-L model**, a core data product. This enhanced the accuracy of the national water balance, showcasing a commitment to continuous product improvement.
*   Led a team of three scientists to analyse and communicate complex research findings. Collaborated with stakeholders to ensure the insights were well-understood and actionable, demonstrating strong communication and leadership skills in a cross-functional environment.

**Monash University**, Melbourne, Developer	12/2019 – 06/2020
*   Built a **Python API** for real-time water market simulations, automating decision modeling with eWater SOURCE.
*   Developed an automated tool for assignment generation, saving 300+ hours of manual processing.
