# Experience

## CSIRO - Research Scientist, Applied ML

### Melbourne, Australia | Jan 2023 - Present

- Architected and delivered the **Hydrological Reservoir Model (HRM)**, a production-ready Python package with a **plugin-based architecture, typed APIs, schema validation, 90%+ test coverage, and full CI/CD automation**. Established a reusable blueprint that other teams now follow for building robust ML packages.
- Shipped an **end-to-end PyTorch-based LSTM model** for streamflow forecasting, owning the full ML lifecycle from feature design and training through evaluation and deployment, achieving 20% higher accuracy than baseline methods.
- Built a **real-time data pipeline using Kubernetes CronJobs** to process daily ECMWF climate forecasts, automating anomaly detection and reducing latency by 25%. Demonstrates hands-on experience with K8s-based ML infrastructure.
- Engineered a **scalable data pipeline on Azure** that processed over 2 million simulations (reduced from months to hours), supporting a high-impact climate adaptation study published in *Nature Sustainability*.
- Designed an **ML-driven data quality tool** for real-time anomaly detection in national water systems, cutting error detection time by 40% and improving reliability for downstream consumers.
- Implemented a **LangChain-based LLM workflow** to analyse 85+ expert questionnaire responses, mapping research priorities for CSIRO's sustainability program.
- Managed multiple concurrent projects simultaneously (HRM package, LSTM model, K8s pipeline, Macquarie analysis, data quality tool, LLM workflow), demonstrating effective context-switching across diverse ML domains.

## Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) - Senior Data Scientist

### Melbourne, Australia | Sep 2018 - Jan 2023

- Led the scientific development and **operational ownership** of Australia's national hydrological model (AWRA-L v7), a critical data product serving thousands of users daily at awo.bom.gov.au.
- Developed and operationalised a **Random Forest-based anomaly detection system** that identified critical infrastructure risks from over 1 million data points with 70% accuracy, deployed as a core component of a national product.
- Built and integrated an **ML forecasting model** for the Australian Fire Danger Rating System, achieving a 30% accuracy boost for predictions up to 3 months ahead.
- **Led a team of three scientists** to prepare and communicate technical research findings through comprehensive reports, demonstrating written communication and mentoring skills.
- **Directed a team of four** to adapt and integrate the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) model, written in C and Python, for Australian conditions.
- Implemented the **Ensemble Kalman Filter** using Bayesian methods and GRACE satellite data to enhance water balance accuracy, bridging advanced statistical research with production model improvements.

## Monash University - Developer

### Melbourne, Australia | Dec 2019 - Jun 2020

- Built a **Python API** for real-time water market simulations, automating decision modelling with eWater SOURCE.
- Developed an automated tool for assignment generation, saving 300+ hours of manual processing.
