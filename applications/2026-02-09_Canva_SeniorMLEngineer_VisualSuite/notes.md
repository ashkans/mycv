## CVs Created

Created tailored CVs for the top 2 roles:
- `applications/2026-02-09_Canva_SeniorMLEngineer_VisualSuite/cv_draft.md`
- `applications/2026-02-09_Canva_SeniorMLEngineer_AIPlatformEnablement/cv_draft.md`

Both emphasise enablement/force-multiplier angle, reusable tooling (HRM as "blueprint"), K8s infrastructure, context-switching, and communication. Summaries differ per team.

## Insider Feedback from RC (2026-02-09 evening)

Emailed RC asking for referral to both roles. RC replied same evening:

1. **AI Platform Enablement role is gone** (filled/closed).
2. **Visual Suite role is open but RC doesn't think it's a good fit.** His view: "The requirements don't really play to your strength. In my head your game should be in a product area where strong expertise in predictive modeling & forecast is needed."
3. RC offered to submit a referral for Visual Suite if I want, but his tone suggests he'd prefer to refer me for a better-matched role.

### Interpretation
- RC knows the teams internally. The enablement roles want a generalist ML platform engineer (inference, serving, evaluations across many domains).
- My actual edge is as a **deep predictive modeling specialist** (LSTM, time-series, forecasting, anomaly detection), not a platform generalist.
- A referral is worth more when the referrer believes in the match. Better to wait for the right role.

### Recommended response to RC
- Thank him for honesty
- Ask if there are product areas at Canva where predictive modeling expertise would be valued (now or upcoming)
- Position him as an ongoing scout rather than burning the referral on a marginal fit
- Don't push for the Visual Suite referral

## Action Items

- [ ] Send reply to RC (drafted above)
- [ ] Keep monitoring Canva careers page for roles matching "predictive modeling / forecasting in a product area"
- [ ] If RC flags a better role, tailor CV immediately and ask for referral
- [ ] Consider the Visual Suite application independently (without referral) if feeling bold, but it's a stretch
- [ ] The AIPlatformEnablement application folder can be archived (role is gone)
