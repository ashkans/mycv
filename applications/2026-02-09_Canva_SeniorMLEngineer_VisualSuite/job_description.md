## About the Team

The Visual Suite Platform Team is an agile group of backend and machine learning engineers that own and maintain the variety of services that underpin the product verticals that make up the Visual Suite (Docs, Presentations, Whiteboards, and more).

## About the Role/Specialty

This role sits at the intersection of solution expertise and platform engineering, requiring deep technical expertise across ML domains combined with strong platform knowledge. You will manage your time across a small number of product teams, operating as an embedded expert who builds deep context and provides sustained enablement rather than surface-level support. This is a Senior MLE role within the Visual Suite platform team, focused on ML Enablement across the Productivity Group.

The nature of enablement work demands someone who operates as a force multiplier, finding satisfaction not just in solving technical problems but in enabling others to move faster.

- Act as a solution expert across ML domains including evaluations, training, inference, data pipelines, quality, and optimisation
- Work directly alongside product teams as a trusted partner, helping them navigate technical challenges and arrive at effective solutions
- Provide expert guidance on platform capabilities, helping teams understand what's possible and how to get there efficiently
- Develop blueprints, patterns, and paved roads that allow other teams to follow proven approaches and accelerate their own implementations
- Debug and resolve complex issues, identifying root causes and sharing learnings broadly
- Balance hands-on problem solving with strategic thinking about how to scale enablement impact across the organisation
