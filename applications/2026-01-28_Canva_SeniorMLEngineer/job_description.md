Description
About the Team

The Revenue Platform group is building Canva’s global monetization engine: a payments platform that processes billions in volume across 190+ countries. The Global Payments team owns the systems that ensure anyone, anywhere can pay for Canva—reliably, securely, and with high conversion.

About the Role

This role is for a senior ML engineer who will build decisioning and optimisation models that sit at the heart of Canva’s payments orchestration layer.

You will be the first machine learning engineer embedded in Global Payments and have the opportunity to define the ML strategy, foundations, and operating model for payments optimisation within the team.

This role is highly cross-functional: you’ll work with payments engineering, data, fraud, and product to ship ML that measurably improves revenue outcomes and customer experience.

What we're looking for

Technical skills

Demonstrated experience building and shipping ML systems end-to-end (feature design → training → evaluation → deployment → monitoring).

Domain knowledge of supervised learning and decisioning systems; experience with exploration/exploitation approaches (bandits) is a plus.

Ability to work with large-scale, noisy transactional data and produce reliable models.

Strong software engineering fundamentals: testing, code quality, APIs, and operational ownership.

Python proficiency; experience with common ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch / TensorFlow / scikit-learn).

Product and platform mindsets

Strong judgment on trade-offs and risk: understands how ML can fail and how to design safe rollouts.

Comfortable working in ambiguous problem spaces and turning them into clear, measurable deliverables.

Ability to communicate clearly with stakeholders across engineering, product, finance, and risk.

Domain experience (nice to have)

Payments, fraud/risk, credit card authorisation, retries/dunning, routing, or experimentation in high-stakes systems.

Familiarity with compliance constraints (PCI scope minimisation, auditability, access controls) in financial systems.
