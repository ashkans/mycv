### Professional Experience

**CSIRO**, Melbourne, Research Scientist | Applied ML	01/2023 – Present
*   Architected and delivered a **production-ready Python package** for a national-scale forecasting system, establishing a high standard for software quality with a **plugin-based design, 90%+ test coverage, and full CI/CD automation**. This demonstrates strong **operational ownership** and fundamentals.
*   Shipped an **end-to-end PyTorch-based LSTM model** for streamflow forecasting, from feature design and training to evaluation and monitoring, improving accuracy by 20% over baselines in a complex, noisy data environment.
*   Engineered a **scalable data pipeline on Azure** that processed over 2 million simulations, showcasing experience with large-scale data systems.
*   Designed and built a **real-time data quality control product** to monitor and ensure reliability for national water data streams, analogous to fraud and integrity systems in a payments context.

**Bureau of Meteorology**, Melbourne, Senior Data Scientist (Hydrologist)	09/2018 – 01/2023
*   Developed and operationalized a **Random Forest-based anomaly detection system** as a core component of a **high-stakes national product**. This decisioning system identified critical infrastructure risks from over 1 million data points with 70% accuracy.
*   Led the scientific development and owned the operational performance of Australia’s national hydrological model, a critical data product serving thousands of users daily.
*   Drove a 30% accuracy boost in the Australian Fire Danger Rating System by building and integrating a new **ML forecasting model**, demonstrating the ability to ship ML that measurably improves a critical system.

**Monash University**, Melbourne, Developer	12/2019 – 06/2020
*   Built a **Python API** for real-time water market simulations, automating decision modeling with eWater SOURCE.
*   Developed an automated tool for assignment generation, saving 300+ hours of manual processing.
