# Match Analysis: FloodMapp EOI — Brisbane, AUS

## Overall Match Score: 92/100

**Recommendation: STRONG APPLY — you are an exceptional fit**

---

## Requirement-by-Requirement Breakdown

### 1. Experience in hydrology, including model development and calibration
**Match: EXCELLENT (10/10)**

- PhD in Civil Engineering (hydrology focus) from Monash University
- Led the scientific development of Australia's national hydrological model (AWRA-L v7) at the Bureau of Meteorology — a government-scale production model serving thousands of users
- Built the Hydrological Reservoir Model (HRM) at CSIRO — production-ready Python package with plugin-based architecture
- 8+ years of domain experience in hydrology and environmental modelling
- Model calibration is core to your PhD and BoM work

### 2. Operational experience with real-time flood forecasting systems
**Match: STRONG (8/10)**

- Developed an end-to-end PyTorch LSTM model for **streamflow forecasting** at CSIRO, achieving 20% higher accuracy than baselines
- Built a **real-time data pipeline** using Kubernetes CronJobs to process daily climate forecasts with automated anomaly detection
- Contributed to the **Australian Fire Danger Rating System** — an operational, real-time national product
- AWRA-L v7 is an operational model used in real-time contexts
- Minor gap: no specific *flood* forecasting system experience (streamflow/climate forecasting is adjacent but not identical)

### 3. Understanding of ML and its application to hydrology, with strong maths/stats
**Match: EXCELLENT (10/10)**

- This is literally your niche — ML applied to hydrology is the thesis of your career
- PyTorch LSTM for streamflow forecasting
- Random Forest anomaly detection on 1M+ data points
- PhD provides the mathematical/statistical foundation
- 20+ publications at the intersection of ML and hydrology
- NeurIPS CCAI reviewer — peer-recognition of ML expertise

### 4. 1D hydraulic / 2D flood modelling (MIKE21, TUFLOW, HEC-RAS)
**Match: GAP (3/10)**

- Your experience is in **hydrological modelling** (rainfall-runoff, land surface models), not **hydraulic modelling** (flood inundation, channel flow)
- No direct experience with MIKE21, TUFLOW, or HEC-RAS mentioned in CV
- However, your strong hydrology fundamentals mean the conceptual gap is small — you understand the physics, just haven't used these specific tools
- This is the only notable gap

### 5. GIS, data collection, manipulation and analysis
**Match: STRONG (8/10)**

- Extensive geospatial data experience (NetCDF, large-scale climate/hydro datasets)
- Processed 2M+ simulations on Azure for geospatial analysis (Nature Sustainability publication)
- Built real-time data pipelines for climate forecast data
- HydroGet side project automates hydrological data retrieval
- Minor gap: no specific GIS software (QGIS, ArcGIS) explicitly listed, though geospatial work implies familiarity

### 6. Python software development with data science toolkits (pandas, scikit-learn)
**Match: EXCELLENT (10/10)**

- Python listed as Expert level
- scikit-learn (Random Forest), PyTorch, extensive pandas/data pipeline work
- Built production-ready Python packages (HRM) with 90%+ test coverage, CI/CD, typed APIs
- Software engineering fundamentals far exceed what they're asking for — you bring proper engineering practices, not just scripting

## Summary of Strengths

1. **Domain unicorn**: PhD hydrology + ML engineering + operational government systems — this combination is extremely rare and exactly what FloodMapp needs
2. **Production experience**: Unlike many researchers, you've built and deployed production systems (AWRA-L v7, HRM, real-time pipelines)
3. **Scale**: You've worked at national scale (BoM, CSIRO) — FloodMapp is trying to scale globally, and you understand what that means for data and models
4. **ML depth**: End-to-end ML lifecycle experience (PyTorch, scikit-learn, evaluation, deployment) applied specifically to hydrology
5. **Engineering quality**: 90%+ test coverage, CI/CD, typed APIs, plugin architecture — you'd bring engineering rigour to a startup that likely needs it

## Key Gaps to Address

1. **Hydraulic modelling**: No MIKE21/TUFLOW/HEC-RAS experience. Mitigate by: (a) emphasizing that hydrological models feed into hydraulic models — you understand the upstream system, (b) expressing willingness to learn, (c) noting that your ML approach may complement or enhance their existing hydraulic modelling
2. **GIS tools**: Not explicitly listed. Mitigate by emphasizing geospatial data processing experience and willingness to upskill
3. **Startup experience**: Your background is government/research. Mitigate by highlighting side projects (full-stack apps, serverless) that show startup-like initiative and velocity

## Salary Expectations

- **Brisbane market rate** for this profile: $140k–$180k AUD base
- **Series A startup**: Likely $130k–$160k AUD base + stock options
- **Your leverage**: Extremely strong — your domain expertise is rare and directly valuable. Don't undersell yourself.

## Strategic Notes

- FloodMapp is a **Series A company** (~30-50 employees) with US expansion ambitions. Your BoM/CSIRO pedigree gives them instant credibility with government clients.
- The EOI is intentionally broad — they're fishing for talent, not filling a specific role. This means they could shape a position around your exact strengths (ML + hydrology).
- Timing is good: Series A companies need to scale their technical team, and your profile could accelerate their ML capabilities significantly.
