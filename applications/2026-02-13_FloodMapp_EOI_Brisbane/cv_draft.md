# Experience

## CSIRO, Melbourne, Research Scientist | Applied ML — 01/2023 – Present

- Architected and delivered the Hydrological Reservoir Model (HRM), a production-ready Python package with plugin-based architecture, typed APIs, schema validation, 90%+ test coverage, and full CI/CD automation. Established a reusable blueprint now adopted by other teams.
- Developed an end-to-end PyTorch-based LSTM model for streamflow forecasting, owning the full ML lifecycle from feature design and training through evaluation, achieving 20% higher accuracy than baseline methods.
- Built a real-time data pipeline using Kubernetes CronJobs to process daily climate forecasts, automating anomaly detection and reducing latency by 25%.
- Engineered a scalable batch pipeline on Azure that processed over 2 million geospatial simulations, supporting a study published in Nature Sustainability.
- Implemented a LangChain-based LLM workflow to analyse 85+ expert responses for a national water policy study.

## Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Senior Data Scientist (Hydrologist) — 09/2018 – 01/2023

- Led the scientific development of Australia's national hydrological model (AWRA-L v7), working closely with production teams to maintain a government-scale operational product serving thousands of users.
- Developed and operationalised a Random Forest-based anomaly detection system (70% accuracy on 1M+ data points) and an ML forecasting model for the Australian Fire Danger Rating System (30% accuracy boost), both deployed as core components of national products.
- Led teams of 3 and 4 scientists across research communication and cross-language model integration (C, Python), demonstrating mentoring and cross-team collaboration skills.
- Contributed to operational forecasting workflows supporting real-time decision-making for emergency management and water resource planning.

## Monash University, Melbourne, Developer — 12/2019 – 06/2020

- Built a Python API for real-time water market simulations, automating modelling with eWater SOURCE.
- Developed an automated assignment generation and marking tool, saving 300+ hours of manual processing per year.
