Dear FloodMapp Careers Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in joining FloodMapp's mission to build a safer future through real-time flood intelligence. As a Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in hydrology and 7+ years of experience building operational forecasting systems at CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, I believe I can make an immediate and meaningful contribution to your team.

**Why FloodMapp resonates with me:**

Throughout my career, I've worked at the intersection of machine learning and hydrology — exactly the space FloodMapp operates in. At the Bureau of Meteorology, I led the scientific development of Australia's national hydrological model (AWRA-L v7), a production system serving thousands of users. At CSIRO, I built an end-to-end PyTorch LSTM model for streamflow forecasting that outperformed baseline methods by 20%, and designed real-time data pipelines using Kubernetes to process daily climate forecasts. I've seen firsthand how better models and faster data can save lives and reduce damage — and I'm excited by FloodMapp's approach to making this technology accessible and operational at scale.

**What I would bring:**

- Deep expertise in **ML applied to hydrology**: PyTorch deep learning, scikit-learn, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection — all applied to water and climate systems
- **Production engineering**: I build systems, not just prototypes. My recent work includes a production-ready Python package with plugin architecture, typed APIs, 90%+ test coverage, and full CI/CD — the kind of engineering rigour that helps startups scale reliably
- **Operational experience**: I understand what it takes to run models in production at national scale, including real-time data pipelines, monitoring, and stakeholder management
- **Python expertise** with strong data science toolkit experience (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch) and modern software engineering practices (Docker, Kubernetes, Azure)

I'm based in Melbourne and open to relocating to Brisbane or working in a hybrid/remote arrangement. I have full working rights in Australia.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background could support FloodMapp's growth. I've attached my resume for your review.

Warm regards,
