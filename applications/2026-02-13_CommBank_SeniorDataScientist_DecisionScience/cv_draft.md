# Summary

Data Scientist with a PhD and 7+ years of experience building production ML systems and predictive models at national scale (CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology). Proven track record in end-to-end model development — from data pipelines and feature engineering through model training, evaluation, and deployment — with deep expertise in statistical modelling, optimisation, and machine learning. Strong software engineering foundations including clean code, CI/CD, 90%+ test coverage, and model lifecycle management. Seeking to apply quantitative modelling and optimisation skills to pricing decisioning and customer-centric AI in retail banking.

# Experience

## CSIRO, Melbourne, Research Scientist | Data Science — 01/2023 – Present

- Architected and delivered a production-ready Python package (HRM) with plugin-based architecture, typed APIs, schema validation, 90%+ test coverage, and full CI/CD automation — establishing a reusable blueprint now adopted by other teams.
- Developed an end-to-end PyTorch-based LSTM model for time-series forecasting, owning the full ML lifecycle from feature design and data pipeline construction through training, evaluation, and deployment, achieving 20% higher accuracy than baseline statistical methods.
- Built a real-time data pipeline using Kubernetes CronJobs to process daily forecasts, automating anomaly detection and reducing data processing latency by 25%.
- Engineered a scalable batch pipeline on Azure that processed over 2 million simulations, supporting a study published in Nature Sustainability and demonstrating capacity to handle high-volume data processing.
- Designed an ML-driven data quality tool to detect anomalies in real-time across national data systems, cutting error detection time by 40%.
- Implemented a LangChain-based LLM workflow to analyse 85+ expert responses, mapping insights to guide strategic research priorities.

## Bureau of Meteorology, Melbourne, Senior Data Scientist — 09/2018 – 01/2023

- Led the scientific development of Australia's national hydrological model (AWRA-L v7), a government-scale operational product serving thousands of users — demonstrating end-to-end model ownership from development through production deployment.
- Developed and operationalised a Random Forest-based anomaly detection system (70% accuracy on 1M+ data points) and an ML forecasting model for the Australian Fire Danger Rating System (30% accuracy boost), both deployed as core components of national decision-support products.
- Led teams of 3 and 4 scientists across research communication and cross-language model integration (C, Python), demonstrating mentoring, collaboration, and ability to influence technical direction.
- Applied Bayesian methods (Ensemble Kalman Filter) for data assimilation, integrating satellite data to improve model accuracy — showcasing statistical modelling depth relevant to pricing and causal inference.
- Contributed to operational forecasting workflows supporting real-time decision-making for emergency management and water resource planning.

## Monash University, Melbourne, Developer — 12/2019 – 06/2020

- Built a Python API for real-time market simulations, automating decision modelling workflows and saving 300+ hours of manual processing per year.
