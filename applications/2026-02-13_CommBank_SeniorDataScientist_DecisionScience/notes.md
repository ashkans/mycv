## Key Positioning Strategy

1. **Lead with optimisation:** PhD optimisation work → pricing optimisation is a natural bridge. Frame as: "I've optimised complex constrained systems at national scale — pricing decisioning is the next application of these same foundations."
2. **Emphasise engineering depth:** CommBank's JD explicitly asks for clean code, testing, and MLOps — this is unusual for a pricing DS role and is your strongest differentiator vs. economics/statistics candidates.
3. **Scale narrative:** BoM national model (thousands of users) → CommBank (millions of customers). Show progression toward larger-scale impact.
4. **Decision support framing:** BoM models supported real-time emergency management decisions. CommBank models support real-time pricing decisions. Same pattern, different domain.
