### 1. Deep Focus Timer: Full-Stack Productivity Web Application

*   **Objective:** Developed a full-stack, deep-flow-based timer and task management web application to enhance productivity during deep work sessions, similar to existing market solutions like Flocus and Pomofocus.
*   **Engineering / Technologies:**
    *   Architected and implemented a **Next.js** (TypeScript, React) frontend with **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui** for a responsive user interface and dynamic task management (add, edit, delete, reorder, prioritize by urgency/importance, session tracking).
    *   Built a **Python 3.11+** backend using **Vercel serverless functions**, integrating **SQLAlchemy** with **Alembic migrations** for robust database management on **Neon PostgreSQL**.
    *   Integrated **Clerk** for user authentication and managed configuration settings (flow phases, themes) via a custom **`useUserConfig` hook** with localStorage fallback and server sync capabilities.
    *   Implemented comprehensive **CI/CD** pipelines and automated testing (frontend with **Jest/React Testing Library**, backend with **Pytest/pytest-cov**), achieving strong test coverage.
    *   Deployed the entire application using **Vercel**, demonstrating expertise in modern full-stack development and cloud deployment strategies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Created a functional, scalable, and user-centric productivity tool showcasing end-to-end development capabilities from database design and API development to responsive UI/UX and deployment.
    *   Demonstrated proficiency in building production-ready applications with robust testing, authentication, and state management, providing a strong foundation for future feature expansion.

### 2. Full-Stack Web Development

*   **Objective:** Acquired practical skills in modern web development to build and deploy end-to-end applications.
*   **Technologies:**
    *   **Backend:** Developed RESTful APIs using **FastAPI** with Python.
    *   **Frontend:** Built user interfaces with **React** and **Next.js**.
    *   **Deployment:** Deployed projects to **Vercel**, demonstrating knowledge of modern serverless and CI/CD workflows.
*   **Status:** While not productionalized, these projects serve as functional proof-of-concepts and a strong foundation for building production-grade ML-powered web services.

### 3. Algorithmic Problem-Solving

*   **Objective:** Strengthened foundational knowledge in computer science and algorithms.
*   **Activities:**
    *   Completed the **MIT 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms** course, covering core data structures, algorithms, and complexity analysis.
    *   Maintained a consistent practice of solving daily challenges on **LeetCode**, demonstrating a commitment to improving coding proficiency.

### 4. C++ and Core Model Contribution

*   **Objective:** Demonstrated the ability to work with and contribute to an existing, large-scale C++ codebase.
*   **Activity:**
    *   Navigated the **SWIFT** hydrological model's C++ source code to make and compile improvements to a reservoir node.
*   **Impact:** This shows an ability to learn and adapt to lower-level languages and complex, established codebases when required, a valuable skill in many engineering teams.

### 5. HydroGet, Solo Developer: Automating RORB Hydrological Modelling

*   **Objective:** Designed and developed a web application to automate the process of RORB calibration.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Enhanced efficiency by reducing manual adjustments and minimizing errors in hydrological modelling workflows.
    *   Technology stack used: **Azure serverless functions, PyRORB, FastAPI, Next.js**.
*   **Impact:** Released an early prototype and collected user feedback to refine functionality and improve user experience.
