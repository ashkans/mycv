### 1. Built the Hydrological Reservoir Model (HRM) Python package

*   **Objective:** Extended CSIRO’s SWIFT forecasting system with new storage/allocation modeling.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Built a plugin-ready architecture with typed APIs, schema validation, **CI/CD** automation, and 90%+ test coverage.
*   **Impact:** Delivered a robust, production-quality Python package that enhances water resource planning.

### 2. Developed LSTM-based Streamflow Forecasting Model

*   **Objective:** Created a streamflow forecasting model using deep learning.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Developed an **LSTM-based streamflow forecasting model (PyTorch)**.
*   **Impact:** Achieved 20% higher accuracy than baseline methods, with direct application to real-time anomaly detection.

### 3. Implemented LangChain-based LLM Workflow

*   **Objective:** Analyzed expert questionnaire responses to guide research priorities.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Implemented a **LangChain-based LLM workflow** to analyze 85+ expert questionnaire responses.
*   **Impact:** Mapped current and emerging domains of water knowledge to guide CSIRO’s sustainability research priorities.

### 4. Built Real-time Data Pipeline with Kubernetes CronJobs

*   **Objective:** Automated processing of climate forecasts for anomaly detection.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Built a real-time data pipeline using **Kubernetes CronJobs** to process daily ECMWF climate forecasts.
*   **Impact:** Automated anomaly detection and reduced latency by 25%.

### 5. Led Macquarie River Hydroclimate Analysis project

*   **Objective:** Designed a scenario-neutral framework to assess river resilience.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Automated 2M+ simulations on **Azure** (months → hours) and developed a stochastic ensemble method to distinguish climate-change impacts from natural variability.
*   **Impact:** Results were adopted by the MDBA for the 2026 Basin Plan Review.

### 6. Designed ML-driven Data Quality Tool

*   **Objective:** Detected anomalies in real-time for national water systems.
*   **Engineering:**
    *   Designed an **ML-driven data quality tool** to detect anomalies in real-time.
*   **Impact:** Improved reliability for national water systems and cut error detection time by 40%.
