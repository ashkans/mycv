# Job Match Analysis

When the user provides a job listing URL (or asks to evaluate roles against their profile), follow this workflow:

## Single Job Evaluation

For a single job URL, delegate to the `/job-match-scorer` subagent. It will open the page, extract the JD, read experience files, and return a structured match report with a score.

## Batch Job Evaluation (multiple listings page)

When the URL points to a search results page with multiple listings:

### Step 1: Collect Job Listings

1. Open the listings page in the browser.
2. Extract all job titles, locations, and links from the results.
3. If there are multiple pages, navigate through them to collect all relevant listings.
4. Filter to only ML/AI/Data Science roles (unless the user specifies otherwise).

### Step 2: Score Each Role

For each relevant role, invoke the `/job-match-scorer` subagent in parallel (up to 4 at a time) with the individual job URL.

### Step 3: Rank and Present Results

Collect the match reports and rank all roles from best match to weakest:

1. **Role name + link** — match score
2. **Why it matches** — 2-3 sentences connecting my experience to the role
3. **Key gaps** — what I'd need to address in my application
4. **Recommendation** — Apply / Stretch / Skip

At the end, give a clear recommendation of which 1-3 roles to prioritise.
