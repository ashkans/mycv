# Job Match Analysis

When the user provides a job listing URL (or asks to evaluate roles against their profile), follow this workflow:

## Step 1: Collect Job Listings

1. Use the Puppeteer MCP tools to navigate to the provided URL.
2. Take a screenshot to verify the page loaded correctly.
3. Extract all job titles, locations, and links using `puppeteer_evaluate` with `console.log()` (this MCP returns values via console output, not return values).
4. If there are multiple pages, navigate through them to collect all relevant listings.
5. Filter to only ML/AI/Data Science roles (unless the user specifies otherwise).

## Step 2: Read Full Job Descriptions

For each relevant role found in Step 1:
1. Navigate to the individual job page using Puppeteer.
2. Extract the full job description text via `puppeteer_evaluate` + `console.log(document.body.innerText)`.
3. Store the key requirements: technical skills, domain experience, responsibilities.

## Step 3: Load My Profile

Read ALL of the following files to build a complete picture of my skills:
- `experiences/exp_csiro.md` — Current role (CSIRO, 2023-Present)
- `experiences/exp_bom.md` — Previous role (Bureau of Meteorology, 2019-2023)
- `experiences/exp_phd.md` — PhD and early career
- `experiences/exp_self_taught.md` — Side projects and self-learning
- `masters/applied_ml_scientist.md` — Master CV template

Also check the `applications/` folder for any prior tailored CVs to the same company.

## Step 4: Analyse and Rank

For each role, produce a comparison table with these columns:

| Requirement | My Match | Evidence |
|---|---|---|

Score each requirement as: **Strong**, **Good**, **Moderate**, **Partial**, or **Gap**.

Then assign an overall **match score (percentage)** based on:
- How many requirements are Strong/Good vs Gap
- Whether the gaps are "must have" or "nice to have"
- How transferable my existing experience is to the gap areas

## Step 5: Present Results

Rank all roles from best match to weakest and present:

1. **Role name + link** — match score
2. **Why it matches** — 2-3 sentences connecting my experience to the role
3. **Key gaps** — what I'd need to address in my application
4. **Recommendation** — Apply / Stretch / Skip

At the end, give a clear recommendation of which 1-3 roles to prioritise.
